 * @brief Fine-grained configuration for text wrapping, mirroring common HTML/CSS semantics.
 *
 * This structure controls where lines are allowed to break and whether a hyphen should appear
 * when a break occurs. It is designed to cover the majority of real-world cases without the
 * overhead of language dictionaries or external libraries. All Unicode code points listed below
 * are recognized in the input byte stream (UTF-8 expected).
 *
 * Behavior overview:
 * - Spaces collapse and provide natural break opportunities (similar to white-space: normal).
 * - No-break space (U+00A0) never breaks.
 * - Soft hyphen (U+00AD) is an *invisible* suggestion; if a line breaks there, a visible '-'
 *   is emitted when @ref hyphenationMode permits (Manual/Auto).
 * - Zero-width space (U+200B) provides a break opportunity *without* a visible hyphen.
 * - Word Joiner (U+2060) prevents a break around it.
 * - Real hyphens '-' are treated as natural break opportunities; no extra '-' is added.
 * - When a token overflows and no prior break opportunity exists, the decision to cut inside
 *   a word is controlled by @ref wordBreakMode and @ref overflowWrapMode.
