bitlib is a C library for Lua 5.1 that provides bitwise operations. It
is copyright Reuben Thomas 2000-2009, and is released under the MIT
license, like Lua (see http://www.lua.org/copyright.html; it's
basically the same as the BSD license). There is no warranty.

Please report bugs and make suggestions to the email address above, or
use the LuaForge trackers.

Thanks to John Passaniti for his bitwise operations library, some of
whose ideas I used, to Shmuel Zeigerman for the test suite, to
Thatcher Ulrich for portability fixes, and to Enrico Tassi, John
Stiles and Eduardo Ochs for bug reports.
